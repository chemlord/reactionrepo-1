    The Two Types of Arrows used in Mechanisms.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
  Representation of electron movement: Representation of electron movement: **two-electron (1 bond) processes (Full-arrow →) vs. one-electron (half bond) processes (Half-arrow ↷)**.
  </p>
</div>

In organic and inorganic mechanisms, arrows are used to show **electron movement**.

### Full Arrows (→) 
  A **full curved arrow** represents the movement of **two electrons**, usually in **bond formation or breaking**. This applies to:
  - Nucleophilic attacks
  - Resonance structures  
  - Electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions
    - Nucleophiles **attack electrophiles** by donating an electron pair to form a new bond.
    - Electrophiles **receive the  nucleophillic attack** to accept an electron pair to form a new bond.

<Note> Nucleophiles donate electron pairs (electron-rich) vs. Electrophiles accept electron pairs (electron-poor).</Note>

### Half Arrows (↷)  
  A **half-arrow** represents the movement of **one electron**, commonly seen in:
  - Radical reactions  
  - Homolytic bond cleavage  
  - Radical propagation steps  

<Note> There will be lots of examples in the entries of Reaction Repo of all reactions mentioned </Note>

## Applications of the Arrows

### Bond Formation

#### Full Arrow



#### Half Arrow



### Forming Resonance Structures

  </p>
</div>

DMSO undergoes resonance, which is represented using a full arrow, indicating the movement of two electrons (one bond). This differs from one-electron processes (shown by half-arrows). The electron pair from the S=O double bond shifts toward oxygen, converting it into a single bond. Since oxygen gains an extra lone pair, it takes on a negative formal charge, while sulfur loses electron density, resulting in a positive charge.
