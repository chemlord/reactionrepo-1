  The overall synthesis of (+)-Cortistatin A started with an enantiomerically pure Hajos-Parrish ketone undergoing key reactions such as diastereoselective hydrogenation, Rubottom oxidation, the Dess-Martin oxidation and other types of reactions to eventually form the target compound (+)-Cortistatin A. This occurs over a 26 step synthesis pathway.

    Dess-Martin Oxidation Usage in Intermediate Formation.

  <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
  This reaction showing the Dess-Martin oxidation of this alcohol intermediate was part of the overall synthesis pathway of the formation of (+)-Cortistatin A. (+)-Cortistatin A is a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation. This compound was synthesized through the conversion of an enantiomerically pure Hajos-Parrish ketone to a known enone and then to a silyloxydiene intermediate. <sup>**2**</sup>
  </p>
</div>

A crucial step in this multi-step process, as depicted above, was the oxidation of a primary alcohol intermediate (14e) formed in the overall synthesis pathway. The alcohol intermediate was converted to an aldehyde intermediate using Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP) (1.2 equiv) in dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature for 1 hour. The resulting aldehyde intermediate (14f) was then further utilized in subsequent steps towards the total synthesis of (+)-Cortistatin A. <sup>**2**</sup>

    Often times, Dess Martin Oxidation is always performed with DMP and a solvent. Usually DMP prefers DCM as a solvent it is highly soluble in DCM. This applies to both primary and secondary alcohol oxidations.

    <Note> If you did not read the [**Reagent Variations section**](/reactionrepo/docs/oxidation-reactions/dess-martin-oxidation/#reagent-variations) on the Dess-Martin Oxidation Overview, please check it out.

  In Dess-Martin oxidation of primary alcohols, the process involves assigning one side chain (R) to understand the reaction better. 
  </p>
</div>

 The colored side chain represents an R group that remains unchanged during the reaction. The alcohol group is selectively oxidized to form an aldehyde. For educational purposes, we conceptually assign the non-alcohol group as R (Side chain) to visualize the changes and reconstruct the molecule post-reaction.

    <Tip>The molecule isn’t taken apart during the reaction, but for understanding the process, we conceptually take it apart to visualize the changes. This allows for easy reconstruction of the molecule after oxidation, emphasizing the selective nature of the reaction for educational purposes.</Tip>
  
  **Guide to Side Chains**

1. **Assign the Side Chain (R)**: Identify the non-alcohol part of the molecule and assign it as the placeholder 'R' or side chain.

2. **Understand Its Role**: This placeholder helps track the unchanged part of the molecule, aiding in visualizing the structure before and after the reaction.

3. **Focus on the Reaction Center**: The primary alcohol is selectively oxidized to form an aldehyde. The placeholder shows how the structure is altered.

4. **Reassign the Side Chain**: After the reaction, reattach the placeholder R to the new aldehyde, demonstrating the unchanged nature of the side chain.

  </p>
</div>

This step involves the alcohol group attacking the iodine center of the Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), resulting in a complex where the alcohol is temporarily bonded to the iodine. During this reaction, an OAc group is expelled from the compound. The expelled OAc group, initially part of the molecule as an acetoxy group, becomes a negatively charged acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) once it leaves. This transition occurs because the OAc group acts as a good leaving group, taking an extra electron pair with it, thereby gaining a negative charge and stabilizing as an acetate ion.

This allows for easy reconstruction of the molecule after oxidation, to visually see the selective nature of the reaction.

2. **Understand Their Role**: These placeholders help track the unchanged parts of the molecule, aiding in visualizing the structure before and after the reaction.

In this step, the secondary alcohol group (-OH) reacts with the Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), similar to the primary alcohol mechanism. The difference lies in the presence of an additional side chain (R²) attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group.

  </p>
</div>

After the initial reaction, the intermediate is stabilized by the expulsion of the acetoxy group (OAc). In the molecule, the OAc group is initially an acetoxy group (CH₃COO-). However, once it is expelled from the Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), it becomes an acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). This occurs because the acetoxy group acts as a good leaving group, taking an extra electron pair with it and becoming a stable, negatively charged acetate ion.

This reaction showing the Dess-Martin oxidation of this alcohol intermediate was part of the overall synthesis pathway of the formation of Clostrubin. Clostrubin is a potent antibiotic against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteria, which was synthesized through a series of steps, including the desilylation of a silylated intermediate during acid workup, which ultmately resulted in the formation of a secondary alcohol intermediate. 

One main reagent used to form clostrubin was the thioester compound (4)

2-Iodophenol underwent a 7-step synthesis to form the needed thioester required to form clostrubin.<sup>**4**</sup>

A crucial step in this multi-step process to form the thioester was the oxidation of a secondary alcohol intermediate (20) formed in the synthesis pathway to a ketone intermediate (21) using Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP) in dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature for 1 minute. The resulting ketone intermediate was then further utilized in subsequent steps to form the needed thioester required to synthesize Clostrubin.<sup>**4**</sup>
