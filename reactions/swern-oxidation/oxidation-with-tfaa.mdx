Swern Oxidation, a mild oxidation method used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones is able to use TFAA as an activator of DMSO. This method is costly and less effective than Oxalyl chloride but was a effective activator prior to the usage of oxalyl chloride.<sup>**1**</sup>

### General Scheme

This section briefly summarizes what can and cannot undergo reactions.

- 1° Alcohols (Primary) get oxidized to **Aldehydes**.
- 2° Alcohols (Secondary) get oxidized to **Ketones**.
- 3° Alcohols (Tertiary) **do not** get oxidized at all.

### General Mechanism

This section briefly summarizes steps to find the product and perform the mechanisms.

**Quick steps to finding the product for any alcohol**
1. Identify the reagents.
2. Assign side chains (non alcohol part).
3. Selectively convert Alcohol to correct product based on alcohol type. Nothing else.
4. Keep the side chains (non alcohol part) the same and piece together the full molecule together again.
