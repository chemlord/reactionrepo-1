  <Tab title="Reaction Help">
    <ThemeCard title="MasterOrganicChemistry" description="Used Master Organic Chemistry whenever I needed general information on a topic. It's especially helpful for building baseline knowledge. Unfortunately there are so many microtransactions and memberships involved for additional resources." image="/additional-resources/moc.png" href="https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/" />
    <ThemeCard title="ChemistrySteps" description="Found ChemSteps to be great for 3rd-year reaction oxidation and radical reactions. Unfortunately, alot of material and practice questions are behind a paywall, which is a bit of a downside. Forget about personal tutoring, it's also very expensive." image="/additional-resources/chemstep.png" href="https://www.chemistrysteps.com/" />
    <ThemeCard title="シン反応機構 - Sin Reaction Mechanism" description="Insane find for learning advanced reaction overviews, though it lacks detailed step-by-step explanations and may not be complete. Online version may not always work - the app is in Japanese. Despite these drawbacks, this was a S-tier find and the creator is a really nice guy." image="/additional-resources/chemswi.png" href="https://chemist.swiswiswift.com/" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Computation Chemistry Tools">
    <ThemeCard title="PubChem Sketcher" description="I've used PubChem Sketcher in the past because it's free and accessible, even though it's not the highest quality. It can be a bit annoying to use and doesn't support reaction mechanisms, but it's still a handy tool for quickly drawing basic chemical structures without any cost." image="/additional-resources/pubchemsketch.png" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//edit3/index.html" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Research Tools">
     <ThemeCard title="Reaxys" description="Probably one of the most important tools you will use. You can search through thousands of patents, substances, and bioactivity. You can also find NMR, IR spectra and Molecular Data. There is also a retrosynthesis tool - pretty good service but it requires a license to use." image="/additional-resources/reaxys.png" href="https://www.reaxys.com/" />
