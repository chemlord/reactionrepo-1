The Wolff–Kishner reduction is a classic organic reaction that reduces aldehydes and ketones to alkanes by converting the carbonyl group into a methylene (–CH₂) group. First reported by Nikolai Kishner in 1911 and independently by Ludwig Wolff in 1912, this reaction is especially useful for base-stable substrates where acidic conditions (like in the Clemmensen reduction) would be unsuitable.

## Predicting the Product

This section is a brief overview on how to find the product for a ketone using a example from a real scientific research paper. The mechanism and steps are the same for aldehyde conversion.

When a carbonyl compound is heated with hydrazine in the presence of a strong base like KOH or potassium tert-butoxide, the carbonyl group is converted to a methylene (–CH2) group.

    Once we've identified the target carbonyl (in this case, a ketone), we can guess two steps are needed to fully convert the carbonyl to the methylene group. Now we need to identify and use the general scheme for Wolff-Kishner to solve for the product.

    The Wolff-Kishner reaction starts with the Ketone (or Aldehyde) and are converted to Hydrazones using Hydrazine. This is followed by Hydrazone conversion to Methylene using a strong base (KOH) and heat (Δ)

    The scheme can be directly applied as done by Kuznetsov et al. (1992) to create the alkane product.

## Mechanism for Carbonyls

This section is a brief overview on how to perform the mechanism for both aldehydes and ketones using the paper from above.

We know the scheme for this reaction and the product. Lets do the mechanism now. 

<Note>For the mechanism, we only **selectively reduce the Ketone**. We not do anything to the rest of the molecule. **R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> represents the rest of the molecule.** </Note>

  <Step title="Ketone to Hydrazone Conversion">

1. Nucleophilic attack: The lone pair on hydrazine’s terminal nitrogen does a backside attack on the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate (alkoxide + protonated N).

2. Proton transfer: A proton shifts from the N–H⁺ group to the alkoxide oxygen, generating a neutral alcohol intermediate.

3. Elimination of water: A base (OH⁻) deprotonates the hydroxyl group, enabling loss of H₂O and forming the C=N double bond (hydrazone).

The Hydrazone is deprotonated by hydroxide and reprotonated by water. Eventually, this leads to removal of a N<sup>2</sup> group. Lastly, a final protonation by water yields the Methylene (alkane) product.
