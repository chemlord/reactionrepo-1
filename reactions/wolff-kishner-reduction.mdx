The Wolff–Kishner reduction is a classic organic reaction that reduces aldehydes and ketones to alkanes by converting the carbonyl group into a methylene (–CH₂) group. First reported by Nikolai Kishner in 1911 and independently by Ludwig Wolff in 1912, this reaction is especially useful for base-stable substrates where acidic conditions (like in the Clemmensen reduction) would be unsuitable.

## Predicting the Product

This section is a brief overview on how to find the product for a ketone using a example from a real scientific research paper. The mechanism and steps are the same for aldehyde conversion.

 The ketones undergo condensation with hydrazine hydrate to afford hydrazones (IIa–e, g), which, upon heating with base, yield the corresponding 3,6-diazahomoadamantanes (IIIb–e, g). Notably, the unsubstituted hydrazone (IIa) undergoes thermal decomposition to form the azine dimer (IVa) instead of the reduced amine. Similar azines (IVb–d) are obtained from substituted hydrazones at elevated temperatures.

This study explores the Wolff–Kishner reduction of 3,6-diazahomoadamantan-9-ones (Ia–g), yielding either reduced amines (IIIb–e, g) or azine dimers (IVa–d) depending on substitution. While substituted hydrazones (IIb–e, g) undergo clean reduction to the corresponding amines, the unsubstituted hydrazone (IIa) instead forms a stable azine (IVa). The work establishes a reliable synthetic route to these products and confirms their structures using IR, ESR, and mass spectrometry.

In this study, the Wolff–Kishner reduction was used to convert 3,6-diazahomoadamantan-9-one hydrazones (compounds IIb–e, IIg) into their corresponding methylene derivatives (IIIb–e, IIIg). 

The process began with the formation of hydrazones by reacting substituted diazahomoadamantanones (Ia–e, Ig) with excess hydrazine hydrate. These hydrazones were then subjected to thermal decomposition by heating them with powdered potassium hydroxide at high temperatures (220–240 °C) for 2–3 hours. Upon cooling, the mixtures were extracted with ether, and the crude products were purified either through sublimation or recrystallization. 

This sequence effectively reduced the ketone group to a methylene yielding stable 3,6-diazahomoadamantanes.

When a carbonyl compound is heated with hydrazine in the presence of a strong base like KOH or potassium tert-butoxide, the carbonyl group is converted to a methylene (–CH2) group.

    Once we've identified the target carbonyl (in this case, a ketone), we can guess two steps are needed to fully convert the carbonyl to the methylene group. Now we need to identify and use the general scheme for Wolff-Kishner to solve for the product.

    The Wolff-Kishner reaction starts with the Ketone (or Aldehyde) and are converted to Hydrazones using Hydrazine. This is followed by Hydrazone conversion to Methylene using a strong base (KOH) and heat (Δ)

## Mechanism for Carbonyls

This section is a brief overview on how to perform the mechanism for both aldehydes and ketones using the paper from above.

We know the scheme for this reaction and the product. Lets do the mechanism now. 

<Note>For the mechanism, we only **selectively reduce the Ketone**. We not do anything to the rest of the molecule. **R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> represents the rest of the molecule.** </Note>

```

1. Hydrazine's terminal nitrogen attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.

2. A proton shifts from the N–H⁺ to the alkoxide, yielding a neutral alcohol.

3. Base deprotonates the hydroxyl group, facilitating loss of water and forming the C=N double bond.

4. Hydrazone is formed. (C=NNH₂).

The Hydrazone is deprotonated by hydroxide and reprotonated by water. Eventually, this leads to removal of a N<sup>2</sup> group. Lastly, a final protonation by water yields the Methylene (alkane) product.
