- 1° Alcohols (Primary) get oxidized to **Aldehydes**.
- 2° Alcohols (Secondary) get oxidized to **Ketones**.
- 3° Alcohols (Tertiary) **do not** get oxidized at all.

### General Mechanism

This section briefly summarizes steps to find the product and perform the mechanisms.

**Quick steps to finding the product for any alcohol**
1. Identify the reagents.
2. Assign side chains (non alcohol part).
3. Selectively convert Alcohol to correct product based on alcohol type. Nothing else.
4. Keep the side chains (non alcohol part) the same and piece together the full molecule together again.
